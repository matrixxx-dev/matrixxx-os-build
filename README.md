# matrixxx-os-build
- This repository is primarily a shell script collection to generate a
  customized os for matrixxx (a D.I.Y linux live system)
  - scripts to download debian packages and install these in images
  - the compilation is ensured by special configuration files
  - as well as the selection of the debian suite (stable testing unstable
    experimental) and the possible software categories (main contrib
    non-free non-free-firmware)
- The result are several squasfs images which contains a customized os
  for x86 32-bit and 64-bit versions
